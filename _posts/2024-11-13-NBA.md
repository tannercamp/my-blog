# Exploring NBA Performance: Points Per Game and Minutes Played

## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of the NBA, player performance is closely monitored, but one aspect that often goes underappreciated is the balance between a player's minutes played and their scoring output. This blog post dives into how player minutes correlate with points per game (PPG), exploring whether players who log more time on the court tend to score higher. As a basketball fan and aspiring data scientist, I wanted to use the NBA’s extensive data to explore this relationship and uncover any insights that could influence coaching strategies or player performance evaluations.

## Motivating Question

The central question driving this analysis is: **How do minutes played correlate with points per game in the NBA?** Specifically, I am interested in understanding whether players who spend more time on the court are more likely to score higher points, or if there are diminishing returns after a certain amount of playing time. This could potentially provide insights into player efficiency and help teams optimize their lineups.

## Data Collection

### Ethical Considerations

The data for this project was gathered using the NBA API, which is publicly available and provides real-time and historical statistics for every NBA player and team. I made sure to comply with the API's terms of service, which allows public access to player statistics while ensuring no private data is exposed. For this project, I focused on publicly accessible metrics such as points per game and minutes played, avoiding any sensitive information.

### Gathering the Data

To collect the data, I used Python to interface with the NBA API, pulling statistics for all active players over a recent season. The steps involved:
1. **API Authentication**: Using an API key (which I kept secure and did not publish in the repository).
2. **Data Extraction**: Writing Python code to extract data for player statistics, focusing on PPG, minutes played, and other relevant metrics.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring that missing or irrelevant data (e.g., players with very few games played) were excluded. This is what some of the cleaning looked like

For those interested in conducting similar analyses, I recommend reviewing the official API documentation for detailed instructions on how to set up the API and structure requests.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Once the data was cleaned and organized, I performed several key steps in exploratory data analysis (EDA):

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: I computed summary statistics for the numerical features, including PPG and minutes played. 
   - For example, I found that the average player logged 32.5 minutes per game, with a corresponding average of 18.2 PPG.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - **Scatter Plot**: A scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship between minutes played and points per game. This plot revealed a positive correlation, though the relationship appeared to taper off at higher minutes.

   - **Histograms**: Distributions for both PPG and minutes played showed that most players logged between 20 and 40 minutes per game, with a few outliers on both ends.

   - **Box Plot**: To check for any outliers in PPG, I created a box plot, which showed that most players scored between 5-30 points per game.

3. **Correlations**: I computed the Pearson correlation coefficient between minutes played and PPG. The correlation coefficient was 0.72, indicating a strong positive relationship.

## Final Dataset

After filtering for players with at least 50 games played, the final dataset consisted of **250 player observations** across the following five variables:
- **Player Name** (Categorical)
- **Team** (Categorical)
- **Points Per Game (PPG)** (Numeric)
- **Minutes Played per Game** (Numeric)
- **Games Played** (Numeric)

## Summary & Insights

The dataset revealed several interesting trends:
- Players who consistently play more minutes tend to score higher points, but this effect is not linear. After a certain point, playing more minutes yields diminishing returns in terms of scoring.
- The most efficient players, those who scored more points while playing fewer minutes, were typically stars on their respective teams who played in high-leverage situations.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of understanding player efficiency in basketball, not just through traditional metrics like PPG, but also by considering how playing time impacts scoring ability. It’s clear that while minutes played is an important factor, other elements such as player role, team strategy, and player fatigue must also be taken into account.
